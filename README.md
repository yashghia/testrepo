# AgileTimes

Welcome to the Sample app for my Pluralsight Course [Building Beautiful Angular Apps with PrimeNG](https://app.pluralsight.com/courses/angular-apps-prime-ng).

The course was officially released on Thursday, Aug 24, 2017.

I'll keep this page updated with breaking changes as the course ages.

## Take it for a spin

I deploy the latest version of the application directly to github pages.
